        <h2>Why two licenses?</h2>
        <p>Some of the decryption code is based on/was copied from/had been inspiried by Maximilian Herczegh. Their iTunes tool helped me to
	not "re-invent the wheel" so to speak. I've made some change pertinent to my work of course, but that code was a good starting
	point to get my de-cryption code to work. If your desire is to single extract images or alter backups, that tool is your choice. This
	tool is more for a total extraction/report generation tool.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
	<h2>Inspiriation</h2>
	<p>In 2021, I committed a python script to pull files from my corrupted backup. It stirred a little interest in the iTunes backup, but
	I never looked back. Later, my friend had an issue with her backup and asked if my tool would work. Well, it doesn't work with the
	unencrypted backups and my friend isn't tech-savvy enough to make the changes. So I began working on an unencrypted version, but
	my friend uses Windows and suggested I make a point and click version. So my python script went to java. Then, to java swing. And
	finally to java FX. And now, it's a full blown application. I learned a lot of java, had fun making it, and if it can save anyone a few
	dollars over those expensive versions that do similar, then I'm happy. It's my hope this application can help others the way it helped
	my friend and I.</p>
