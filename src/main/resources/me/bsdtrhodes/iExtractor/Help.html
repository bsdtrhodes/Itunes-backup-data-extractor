        <h2>Extracting Data</h2>
	<p>Click the File menu drop down and click "Select Backup Directory" to set the iTunes backup directory. On Windows, this
	is currently in <b>C:\users\%USER%\Apple\MobileSync\Backup</b> with a random directory name. Some users may have more
	than a single directory. I have three and so I go to the most recently created one. Once you reach the directory,
	just select "Choose Folder" and the drop down will show a check mark. The check mark shows you have selected a backup
	directory and proceed to the next step.</p>
	<p>Click the File menu drop down and click "Select Export Directory" to se the restore location on the local system. The
	backup contains a great deal of data, including photos, videos, text messages and more. Any directory you choose will
	have a finalized set of voicemail files, image directories, and HTML reports. Images are not exported with the backup's
	initial run - to extract them, run a backup and then view the images by pressing the button associated with images.</p>
        <p>Click the File Menu drop down and click "Perform Extraction" to begin the extraction process.</p>
	<p>If the backup was encrypted, a prompt will appear requesting that you enter your password. If the wrong password is
	entered, errors will be displayed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Getting Password Hashes</h2>
        <p>Click the Reports menu drop down and click "Dump Hashes" to begin this process. A pop-up box will ask you to select the
	iTunes backup directory. Password hashes will already be in a format that Hashcat can read, place them into a text file and
	pass them to Hashcat.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
	<h2>Generating a Report</h2>
	<p>iExtractor comes with the ability to generate reports. To create a report, click the Reports drop down and click "Create Report" prior
	running an extraction. This will create a text file report which can be viewed inside the applicating using the Clipboard image or a
	text file report inside the export directory.</p>
	<p>In addition to the report file, a group of CSV files will be placed in the directory. They contain raw data in CSV (comma separated
	values) format that could be imported into an application such as LibreOffice, Microsoft Office, or any text editor. They could be
	manipulated on the command line using sed and awk or Windows Power Shell.</p>
    </div>
    <div class=section">
	<h2>Errors</h2>
	<p>If you encounter an error performing extractions, please ensure that both the Backup and Export directories were set. If the error
	persists, please double check the unlock password being used. If error is encountered again, please look for an iExtractor.log file.
	It will be in the launch directory, and send it to me for review. I have attempted to test this application on Windows 10,
	FreeBSD, Linux, and Apple OSX. Unfortunately, I cannot test every edge case and situation and I imagine different environments or
	character encodings could cause issues.</p>
